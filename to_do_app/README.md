## 📝 Project: ToDo App

I’ve created a new Flutter app called **ToDo** 🎯  
This app allows users to:

- Add and display daily tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Automatically move completed tasks to a separate section
- Smooth and clean UI with task status indicator

Currently, the core logic and UI structure are done.  
More features like animations, task editing, and persistent storage will be added soon. 🚀
